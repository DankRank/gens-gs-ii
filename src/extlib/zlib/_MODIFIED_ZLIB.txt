This copy of zlib-1.2.5 is a modified version of the original.

In particular, the CMakeLists.txt file has been updated to prevent
building the Win32 resource data when being built as a shared
library. Also, example binaries are no longer built.

Also, several patches from the Gentoo source tree have been included.
