Gens/GS II TODO List

Technical Preview 1:

Infrastructure:
- CMake: Add RelWithDebInfo, MinSizeRel configurations.
- Use z_crc_t in all places where CRCs are used.
  - Need to check zlib for z_crc_t; if not found, fall back.
  - https://github.com/google/zopfli/issues/25
- Set up CPACK.
- Inhibit screensaver when not paused.
  - SDL should inhibit screensaver by default, but we need to
    disable this when paused.
  - For Qt4: https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/desktop/aa373208%28v=vs.85%29.aspx
    - and check how SDL handles it.
- SRAM quirk: Change "No SRAM" value to a bitfield enum, and use it for
  more than just "No SRAM". (e.g. different/no checksum algorithms)
- localtime_r():
  - Call tzset() before using this function. (manpage says it may be necessary)
- Create and use 'typedef super' in all C++ classes.
- x86 asm: Always use __asm__ __volatile__ for 'emms' instructions.
- Remove automatic GPL printout from libgens startup.
  - Just print out libgens version information.
  - GPL can be printed using various options.

Sega Pico:
- Add pen support.

libzomg:
- Finish up metadata. (Sync with PNG metadata.)
- Don't compress files smaller than a certain size. (<=32 bytes?)
- Basic GSX loader, including Gens+ extras:
  - gzipped save file
  - minishot (stored *after* the gzip data)
  - class Gsx : public ZomgBase;
- Rename ZomgBase to SaveBase so it doesn't get confused with the Zomg class.

OpenGL (gens-sdl):
- Aspect ratio constraint: Use integers?

Windows:
- MSVC: Use /W3 or /W4; fix all warnings.
  - Probably just /W3...
  - cmake appears to set /W3 by default?
- Set console code page to UTF-8.
- Win7 PC with NV: gens-sdl has a frame of whiteness on startup...
  - XP VM: frame of garbage instead
- W32U_alloca.h: Add reference:
  - https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/desktop/aa365247%28v=vs.85%29.aspx
- W32U_mini.c: Use GetVersionEx() instead of GetModuleHandleW().
  - KernelEx implements GetModuleHandleW().
- aligned_malloc(): Return with an error if alignment is 0
- MinGW: Define __MINGW_MSVC_COMPAT_WARNINGS
  - See _mingw_mac.h.

================================================================

After Technical Preview 1:

Infrastructure:
- Check for dlopen() in libc, then libdl.
- Switch from GLEW to libepoxy: https://github.com/anholt/libepoxy
- Upgrade to cmake-3.2?
  - cmake-3.1 adds language version checking.
  - Also check for headers, reentrant functions, etc.
- Remove all Decompressors in favor of using libarchive.
  - Write a simple C++ wrapper around libarchive with a similar interface as Decompressor.
- Add compile-time options to disable 15, 16, and/or 32-bit color selectively.
  - e.g. disable 32-bit on Wii.

System emulation:
- Consolidate various options into hardware sets:
  - MD1/MD2: Disable TAS on M68K memory, enable 2-column VScroll bug.
  - Genesis 3: Enable TAS on M68K memory, disable 2-column VScroll bug.
- Rework clocking to 3420 cycles per line.

CPU emulation:
- Switch to CZ80: (in progress, see switch-to-libz80 branch)
  - http://notaz.gp2x.de/releases/PicoDrive/PicoDrive_135src.tar.bz2
  - http://notaz.gp2x.de/pico.php
- Lock up the CPU(s) if an invalid memory address is accessed.
  - Show OSD message.
  - Add configuration option to disable this.
- 68000: Handle "open bus" reads. (Should show prefetch.)

VDP emulation:
- Rewrite the entire DMA infrastructure:
  - DMA transfers should be done bits at a time, instead of
    all at once and simulating CPU waits.
- Verify behavior of VBL/HBL flags.
- Start of frame was moved to visible line 0 to fix the
  multitap I/O test ROM; however, genplus-gx moved start
  of frame to physical line 0. The issue with Gens/GS II
  was probably caused by timing inaccuracies elsewhere.
- Sega 8-bit mode: Allow user to select VDP models.
  - SG-1000: TMS9918A vs. SMS - different color palette.
  - SMS1 vs. SMS2: Bugs with undocumented VDP register bits (required for JP Ys)
  - SMS2/GG/MD: Fixes bugs; x224 and x240 modes.
  - MD has some other differences.
- Properly handle access to invalid VDP addresses from CPU.
- Also handle access to invalid VDP codewords.
  - Show an OSD message if this happens.
- Add FIFO support.

Sega Pico:
- Add ADPCM support.

Qt4 UI:
- Backport gens-sdl framedropping code.
- Add UI for configuring key shortcuts.
  - Include options for "Kega Default" and "Regen Default".
- Get rid of custom menu parsing. Use Qt Designer instead.
  - Figure out how to do system-native icons afterwards.
  - Raise minimum Qt version to 4.8?
  - Rework keyboard shortcuts...
- Sega CD Control Panel: Add animated icon overlay with region-specific
  logo for Sega CD discs.

Onscreen Display:
- Rework to use a class with EmuContext and more comprehensive information.
- Add message categories with different colors for each category.
  - Categories: Error, Warning, Information

Windows:
- Add custom UTF-8 conversion for Win95? (or not)
- GetCommandLineW() is implemented on Win9x, may not need to
  implement argv conversion for ANSI.
- Tech Preview 2: Investigate use of MS Layer for Unicode.
  - https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/goglobal/bb688166.aspx
  - MSVCRT doesn't use MSLU unless custom-compiled...
    - https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/microsoft.public.platformsdk.mslayerforunicode/gonOpMysWEU
