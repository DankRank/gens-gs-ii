1. What is Zipped Original Memory from Genesis?

Zipped Original Memory from Genesis, or ZOMG, is a new savestate format
for emulators for Sega consoles, including the Sega Master System and
the Sega Genesis / Mega Drive. Whereas most savestate formats have hardcoded
offsets for segments, ZOMG uses a Zip file that contains each segment as
a separate file.

The pathname convention used in this document is Unix-style; however,
Windows-style pathnames can be used for emulators running on Windows.

Due to the similarities between most of the Sega 8-bit and 16-bit systems,
common components shared between the systems will be stored in a /common
subdirectory. System-specific data will be stored in a system-specific
subdirectory, e.g. /SMS for Sega Master System or /MD for Sega Mega Drive.

Save files may have a specified endianness. They are "BE" for Big Endian
(Motorola format) and "LE" for Little Endian (Intel format), along with
an optional word-size specifier.

All structs are packed; that is, they do not have any padding that would
usually be added by a compiler. On gcc, this is achieved by using
__attribute__ ((packed)). On MSVC and other compilers, this may be
done by using #pragma pack(1), followed by #pragma pack() after the
struct definition.

================================================================

2. format.ini

Every ZOMG archive contains at least one file: /format.ini
This file is a text file in INI format, encoded using UTF-8.
Line endings may be either Unix-style ("\n") or Windows-style
("\r\n"). Linebreaks may be embedded within values by using the
"\n" escape sequence.

Here is an example FORMAT.ini file:

[ZOMG]
FileType=Zipped Original Memory from Genesis
Version=0.1
System=MD
Creator=Genesis Emulator 2.12.194
Author=Mario Mario
ROM=Sonic the Hedgehog (W) (REV01) [!].gen
ROM CRC32=AFE05EEE
Region=JUE
Description=Sample savestate from Sonic 1.
Extensions=

Fields: ('*' indicates required; '-' indicates optional.)

* FileType: Contains the filetype. Must be "Zipped Original Memory from Genesis".
* Version: ZOMG specification version number.
* System: Systems used for the savestate, comma-separated.
- Creator: Program that created the savestate.
- Author: Person who created the savestate.
- ROM: Filename of the ROM file used to create the savestate.
- ROM CRC32: CRC32 checksum of the ROM file used to create the savestate.
- Region: Region code of the system used to create the savestate.
- Description: A short description of the savestate.
- Extensions: Any extensions to the base format, comma-separated.

For the System value, System may be a combination of more than one system.
Each system is comma-separated and case-insensitive.

Acceptable values for Version 0.8:
- MD: Mega Drive / Genesis.

Planned values for Version 0.9/1.0:
- MCD: Mega CD / Sega CD. (implies MD)
- 32X: Sega 32X. (implies MD)

Planned values for Version 1.1/1.2:
- SMS: Sega Master System.
- GG: Game Gear. (implies SMS)

For Sega CD games, the System value would contain either "MCD" or "MD,MCD".
Sega CD 32X games would have a System value of either "MCD,32X" or "MD,MCD,32X".

The ROM field is for user reference only. It should not be used by an emulator
to determine which ROM to load, or if a savestate is valid for a given ROM.

The Extensions field is usually blank for ZOMG files conforming to the
ZOMG version listed in the Version field. It is included to allow for
custom extensions to the format.

Note: For improved usability, the emulator may also store some of the fields
in the Zip Comments section. The Zip Comments section is only to be used as
a descriptive item and should not be interpreted as format information.

3. Optional files in the root directory

The following files are optional, but highly recommended:

/preview.png: A preview screenshot of the savestate.

================================================================

4. Common components

The following files are contained in the /common directory. These refer to
components that are common throughout the Sega 8-bit and 16-bit hardware line.

+----------------+----------------+------------+
| Filename       |  Size (bytes)  | Endianness |
+----------------+----------------+------------+
| vdp_reg.bin    |      8; 11; 24 |    8-bit   |
| VRam.bin       | 16,384; 65,536 |   Varies   |
| CRam.bin       |    32; 64; 128 |   Varies   |
| psg.bin        |             23 |    8-bit   |
| Z80_mem.bin    |    1, 2, 8 KiB |    8-bit   |
| Z80_reg.bin    |             28 |     LE     |
+----------------+----------------+------------+

----------------------------------------------------------------

4.1. vdp_reg.bin: Sega VDP registers (TMS9918A-like)

This file contains the user-accessible registers found in the VDP used
on Sega's 8-bit and 16-bit consoles. The SG-1000 and SG-1000 Mark II
both used a TMS9918A, while the Sega Mark III and later used custom VDPs.
Each register is 8 bits wide.

Depending on the system being emulated, the number of VDP registers
may vary:

- SG-1000 (TMS9918A):   8 registers
- Sega Mark III (SMS): 11 registers
- Sega Mega Drive:     24 registers

vdp_reg.bin contains only the VDP registers, so the C equivalent may
look like this:

uint8_t vdp_reg_tms9918a[8];	// TMS9918A-based systems. (SG-1000, ColecoVision)
uint8_t vdp_reg_mk3[11];	// Sega Mark III / Sega Master System.
uint8_t vdp_reg_md[24];		// Sega Mega Drive.

----------------------------------------------------------------

4.2. VRam.bin: Video RAM

Video RAM is directly connected to the Video Display Processor on
the Sega 8-bit and 16-bit machines. Depending on the system, it may
have a different size and format:

- All Sega 8-bit systems: 16,384 bytes; 8-bit
- Sega Mega Drive:        32,768 words; 16-bit BE

C equivalents for VRam.bin:
uint8_t vram_8bit[16384];	// Sega 8-bit systems.
uint16_t vram_md[32768];	// Sega Mega Drive. (16-bit BE)

----------------------------------------------------------------

4.3. CRam.bin: Color RAM

Starting with the Sega Mark III, Sega's 8-bit and 16-bit VDPs
have included Color RAM, which allows the onscreen palette to
be remapped. There are three different Color RAM formats.

- Sega Mark III (SMS):  32 bytes; 8-bit (6 bits per color usable)
- Sega Mega Drive:     128 bytes; 16-bit BE (9 bits per color usable)
- Sega Game Gear:       64 bytes; 16-bit LE (12 bits per color usable)

C equivalents for CRam.bin:
uint8_t cram_mk3[32];		// Sega Mark III / Sega Master System.
uint16_t cram_md[64];		// Sega Mega Drive. (16-bit BE)
uint16_t cram_gg[32];		// Sega Game Gear. (16-bit LE)

----------------------------------------------------------------

4.4. psg.bin: TI SN76489(A) Programmable Sound Generator

This file contains the register values from the TI SN76489(A) Programmable
Sound Generator. This chip is used for generating square waves and noise.

Note that the SG-1000 and SG-1000 Mark II systems used an SN76489, while
the Sega Mark III and later used an SN76489A integrated in the VDP. The
primary difference is the linear feedback shift register length. In the
SN76489, the register is 15 stages, while in the SN76489, the register is
16 stages. (This is hardware-dependent, and is not stored in psg.bin.)

Additionally, the Game Gear variant of the PSG supports stereo sound.
The stereo field in the psg.bin file is used for this purpose, and should
be ignored for all other systems.

Layout of the stereo byte: (active high)
+-----+---------+-------+
| Bit | Channel | Side  |
+-----+---------+-------+
|  0  |    0    | Right |
|  1  |    1    | Right |
|  2  |    2    | Right |
|  3  |    3    | Right |
|  4  |    0    | Left  |
|  5  |    1    | Left  |
|  6  |    2    | Left  |
|  7  |    3    | Left  |
+-----+---------+-------+

For the tone_reg[] field, the Tone channels (0-2) have 10 significant bits,
while the Noise channel (3) has 3 significant bits.

For the vol_reg[] field, each channel has 4 significant bits.

For the tone_ctr[] field, if an emulator does not support saving the
internal counters, it should write 0xFFFF to indicate this.

For the gg_stereo field, if an emulator does not support Game Gear stereo,
set the field to 0xFF.

C equivalent for psg.bin:

typedef struct _ZOMG_psg_t
{
	uint16_t tone_reg[4];	// LE16: Tone values for each channel.
	uint8_t vol_reg[4];	// 8-bit: Volume values for each channel.
	
	uint16_t tone_ctr[4];	// LE16: Internal counter values for each channel.
	uint16_t lfsr_state;	// LE16: Linear Feedback Shift Register state.
	
	uint8_t gg_stereo;	// 8-bit: Stereo register. (Game Gear only.)
} ZOMG_psg_t;

----------------------------------------------------------------

4.5. Z80_mem.bin: Zilog Z80 memory.

This file contains the system memory that is directly accessible by the
Z80 CPU. The Z80 memory size depends on the console. Z80 memory is 8-bit,
since the Z80 CPU is an 8-bit processor.

Memory sizes:
- Sega SG-1000:        2,048 bytes
- ColecoVision:        1,024 bytes
- Sega Mark III (SMS): 8,192 bytes
- Sega Mega Drive:     8,192 bytes

C equivalents for Z80_mem.bin:

uint8_t Z80_mem_sg1000[2048];	// Sega SG-1000.
uint8_t Z80_mem_cv[1024];	// ColecoVision.
uint8_t Z80_mem_mk3[8192];	// Sega Mark III (SMS), Sega Mega Drive

----------------------------------------------------------------

4.6. Z80_reg.bin: Zilog Z80 registers.

This file contains the registers found in the Z80 CPU.

C equivalent for Z80_reg.bin:

typedef struct _ZOMG_Z80_reg_t
{
	// Main register set.
	uint16_t AF;	// 16-bit LE: AF register.
	uint16_t BC;	// 16-bit LE: BC register.
	uint16_t DE;	// 16-bit LE: DE register.
	uint16_t HL;	// 16-bit LE: HL register.
	uint16_t IX;	// 16-bit LE: IX register.
	uint16_t IY;	// 16-bit LE: IY register.
	uint16_t PC;	// 16-bit LE: PC register.
	uint16_t SP;	// 16-bit LE: SP register.
	
	// Shadow register set.
	uint16_t AF2;	// 16-bit LE: AF' register.
	uint16_t BC2;	// 16-bit LE: BC' register.
	uint16_t DE2;	// 16-bit LE: DE' register.
	uint16_t HL2;	// 16-bit LE: HL' register.
	
	// Other registers.
	uint8_t IFF;	// 8-bit: IFF flipflops. [0 0 0 0 0 0 IFF2 IFF1]
	uint8_t R;	// 8-bit: R register.
	uint8_t I;	// 8-bit: I register.
	uint8_t IM;	// 8-bit: IM register. (0, 1, 2)
} ZOMG_Z80_reg_t;

================================================================

5. Mega Drive-specific components

The following files are contained in the /MD directory. These refer to
components that are specific to the Sega Mega Drive hardware.

+----------------+----------------+------------+
| Filename       |  Size (bytes)  | Endianness |
+----------------+----------------+------------+
| VSRam.bin      |             80 |  16-bit BE |
| YM2612_reg.bin |            512 |    None    |
| M68K_mem.bin   |         65,536 |  16-bit BE |
| M68K_reg.bin   |             74 |     BE     |
| IO.bin         |             16 |    8-bit   |
| Z80_ctrl.bin   |              4 |    8-bit   |
+----------------+----------------+------------+

----------------------------------------------------------------

5.1. VSRam.bin: Vertical Scroll RAM

This file contains the Vertical Scroll RAM found in the Mega Drive VDP.
This memory controls the vertical scrolling attributes.

40 words are available in VSRam. Depending on the scrolling mode, even words
control 2-cell columns in plane A and odd words control 2-cell columns in
plane B, or the first two words control the entirety of plane A and plane B,
respectively.

C equivalent for VSRam.bin:

typedef struct _ZOMG_Z80_reg_t
{
	uint16_t md_vsram[40];		// 16-bit BE: Vertical Scroll RAM.
};

Alternate C equivalent for VSRam.bin with simplified A/B access:

typedef struct _ZOMG_Z80_reg_t
{
	uint16_t md_vsram[20][2];	// 16-bit BE: Vertical Scroll RAM.
};

----------------------------------------------------------------

5.2. YM2612_reg.bin: Yamaha YM2612 registers

This file contains the user-accessible registers found in the Yamaha YM2612
FM synthesis chip used on the Sega Mega Drive. Each register is 8 bits wide,
and the registers are split into two 256-register banks.

Note: The internal YM timer counters are not stored in this file.
They may be added to another file later on.

C equivalent for YM2612_reg.bin:

uint8_t ym2612_reg[2][512];	// 8-bit: Yamaha YM2612 registers.

----------------------------------------------------------------

5.3. M68K_mem.bin: Main MC68000 memory.

This file contains the 64 KiB main memory connected to the MC68000.
Main memory is accessed in 16-bit words in big-endian notation.

C equivalent for M68K_mem.bin:

uint16_t m68k_mem[32768];	// 16-bit BE: M68K memory.

----------------------------------------------------------------

5.4. M68K_reg.bin: Main MC68000 registers.

This file contains the registers found in the MC68000 CPU.

Note: The alternate stack pointer can be either the user stack pointer or
the supervisor stack pointer, depending on the status register. The other
stack pointer is stored as areg[7], so we don't have to differentiate between
the two in the save file.

C equivalent for M68K_reg.bin:

typedef struct _ZOMG_M68K_reg_t
{
	uint32_t areg[8];	// 32-bit BE: Address registers.
	uint32_t dreg[8];	// 32-bit BE: Data registers.
	uint32_t pc;		// 32-bit BE: Program counter.
	uint32_t asp;		// 32-bit BE: Alternate stack pointer.
	uint16_t sr;		// 16-bit BE: Status register.
} ZOMG_M68K_reg_t;

----------------------------------------------------------------

5.5. IO.bin: Mega Drive I/O state.

This file contains the current state of the I/O ports in the $A10000 region.

Each I/O port has a 16-bit address; however, only the low byte is mapped to
an actual register, so only the low byte will be stored in IO.bin.

Notes:

- The version register ($A10001) only has two bits relevant for savestates:
  NTSC/PAL and East/West. These bits should be restored by changing the
  system region setting when loading the savestate, but this can be
  overridden by the user.

- For the Control Port Data registers, the saved value should be the last
  value written to the port by the M68K.

- If an emulator doesn't support a particular Control Port or specific
  functionality of a Control Port, fill in the unsupported fields using
  the following values:

  * Data: 0xFF
  * Ctrl: 0xFF
  * Serial TxData: 0xFF
  * Serial RxData: 0xFF
  * Serial Control: 0x00

C equivalent for IO.bin:

typedef struct _ZOMG_MD_IO_t
{
	uint8_t version_reg;	// $A10001: Version register.
	uint8_t port1_data;	// $A10003: Control Port 1: Data.
	uint8_t port2_data;	// $A10005: Control Port 2: Data.
	uint8_t port3_data;	// $A10007: Control Port 3: Data.
	uint8_t port1_ctrl;	// $A10009: Control Port 1: Ctrl.
	uint8_t port2_ctrl;	// $A1000B: Control Port 2: Ctrl.
	uint8_t port3_ctrl;	// $A1000D: Control Port 3: Ctrl.
	uint8_t port1_ser_tx;	// $A1000F: Control Port 1: Serial TxData.
	uint8_t port1_ser_rx;	// $A10011: Control Port 1: Serial RxData.
	uint8_t port1_ser_ctrl;	// $A10013: Control Port 1: Serial Control.
	uint8_t port2_ser_tx;	// $A10015: Control Port 2: Serial TxData.
	uint8_t port2_ser_rx;	// $A10017: Control Port 2: Serial RxData.
	uint8_t port2_ser_ctrl;	// $A10019: Control Port 2: Serial Control.
	uint8_t port3_ser_tx;	// $A1001B: Control Port 3: Serial TxData.
	uint8_t port3_ser_rx;	// $A1001D: Control Port 3: Serial RxData.
	uint8_t port3_ser_ctrl;	// $A1001F: Control Port 3: Serial Control.
} ZOMG_MD_IO_t;

----------------------------------------------------------------

5.6. Z80_ctrl.bin: Z80 control logic.

The Sega Mega Drive has a Z80 as a secondary processor. In order to control
access to the Z80, the main 68000 has special control registers to control
the state of the Z80 bus as well as the memory accessible in the Z80 banking
page (0x8000-0xFFFF in Z80 space).

C equivalent for Z80_ctrl.bin:

typedef struct _ZOMG_MD_Z80_ctrl_t
{
	uint8_t busreq;		// 8-bit: BUSREQ state.
				// 0 == M68K has the bus.
				// 1 == Z80 has the bus.
	
	uint8_t reset;		// 8-bit: RESET state.
				// 0 == Z80 is running.
				// 1 == Z80 is RESET.
	
	uint16_t m68k_bank;	// 8-bit: M68K banking register.
				// Low 9 bits of m68k_bank indicate
				// high 9 bits of M68K address space
				// for the Z80 banking space.
} ZOMG_MD_Z80_ctrl_t;
