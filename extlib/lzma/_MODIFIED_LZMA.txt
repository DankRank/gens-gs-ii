This copy of the LZMA SDK 9.20 is a modified version of the original.

The following changes have been made to the original:
- CMake build system.
- LZMA/7z/Xz encoding has been removed.
- LzmaLib wrappers have been removed.
- MtCoder (multi-threaded coder) has been removed.
- Threads.c/Threads.h (Windows-specific) have been removed.
- LzfindMt.c/LzFindMt.h (Windows-specific) have been removed.
- fseek() and ftell() have been replaced with fseeko() and ftello()
  for Large File Support on Unix and Linux platforms. (7z uses native
  Win32 functions on Windows, so Windows is not affected by this change.)
