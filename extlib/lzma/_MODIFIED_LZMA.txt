This copy of the LZMA SDK 15.14 is a modified version of the original.

The following changes have been made to the original:
- CMake build system.
- fseek() and ftell() have been replaced with fseeko() and ftello()
  for Large File Support on Unix and Linux platforms. (7z uses native
  Win32 functions on Windows, so Windows is not affected by this change.)
- Ppmd7.c and Ppmd8.c now include <string.h> on non-Windows compilers
  instead of <memory.h>:
  - glibc: memory.h is simply a wrapper for string.h.
  - devkitPPC: memory.h doesn't exist; the functions are in string.h.

The following files are still present, but are not compiled:
- LZMA/7z/Xz encoding.
- LzmaLib wrappers.
- MtCoder (multi-threaded coder)
- Threads.c/Threads.h (Windows-specific)
- LzFindMt.c/LzFindMt.h (Windows-specific)
