This copy of GLEW 1.10.0 is a modified version of the original.

It contains only glew.c and the header files, as well as the
informational text files.

This version of GLEW has been customized to include only the
extensions that are either required by GLEW, currently in use
by Gens/GS II, or are planned to be used by Gens/GS II.

See http://glew.sourceforge.net/advanced.html for information on
customizing GLEW to include only specific extensions.
