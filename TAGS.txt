Description of git tags for Gens/GS II:

gens-qt4-GeneralConfigWindow-v4: Qt Desginer improvements for the
GensLineEdit widget and some improvements in UnRAR warning messages
on Unix systems.

gens-qt4-McdControlWindow-v2: Added signal-based updating when using
FindCdromUDisks. The dropdown box is automatically updated whenever
a signal is received from UDisks. Additionally, a simple filename-based
FindCdromUnix backend has been added. This backend only supports Linux
at the moment, but will be expanded to support other Unix systems later.
(Mac OS X will have its own backend based on IOKit.)

gens-qt4-ZipSelectDialog-v1: Rewrote ZipSelectDialog to use a QTreeView
and a custom QAbstractItemModel subclass. Files are now shown in a
hierarchical view if directories are present within the archive.

gens-qt4-McdControlWindow-v1: Initial Win32 CD-ROM detection.

- The disc label is read using GetVolumeLabel(), and icons are obtained
  using SHGetFileInfo(). Disc type and drive type are assumed to be CD-ROM,
  since that information isn't as easily obtainable as with UDisks. It's
  also not necessary in order to determine the icon on Win32, since the
  icon is obtained from the system.

- Initial SPTI wrapper. This wrapper will also be used for the Win32
  McdReader class later on.

gens-qt4-McdControlWindow-v0: Initial "Sega CD Control Panel" window.
It currently displays any detected CD-ROM drives using the new
FindCdromUDisks class, which is based on the FindCdromBase class.
Disc icon, drive model, and disc label information are displayed,
as well as the device filename.

gens-qt4-GeneralConfigWindow-v3: Added a "General" tab, which allows for
configuration of various options, including OSD settings. OSD settings are
applied to GensConfig and GensQGLWidget; other settings don't do anything
yet. UnRAR settings are now applied to both GensConfig and DcRar.

gens-qt4-GeneralConfigWindow-v2: UnRAR, RAR, and UnRAR.dll files are now
detected correctly on all platforms. The UnRAR binary is *not* yet applied
to DcRar when settings are saved.

gens-qt4-GeneralConfigWindow-v1: New GensConfig class to store configuration
information. Added initial UnRAR binary selection to the "General Configuration"
window and support for GensConfig for Sega CD Boot ROMs and UnRAR binary.
TODO: Add UnRAR binary detection to determine if the selected binary (or DLL
on Win32) is usable.

gens-qt4-GeneralConfigWindow-v0: Initial "General Configuration" window.
It currently implements Sega CD Boot ROM detection, which is somewhat
useless right now because Sega CD isn't implemented. (Changes aren't
saved anywhere, either.) Sega Boot ROMs must be uncompressed in order
to be detected at the moment. Decompressor support will be added later.

mcd_pcm-0.1: Sega CD PCM Utility v0.1. This utility can convert Sega CD
PCM samples to standard unsigned 8-bit WAV files with configurable
starting position, length, and sample rate.

gens-no-emulation-build: Added support for "No-Emulation" builds, i.e.
builds of Gens/GS II without the CPU emulators. This is useful for testing
the Gens/GS II framework on non-x86 CPUs, since the CPU emulators are still
written in 32-bit x86 assembly language.

gens-qt4-paused-v0: Initial paused support. Emulation is paused if Escape
is pressed, and unpaused if Escape is pressed again. I'll need to write a
new class to handle non-controller keypresses in order to clean up the
paused code. This class will also handle stuff like savestate slot keys.

gens-qt4-ZipSelectDialog-v0: Initial implementation of the Multi-File
Archive Selection Dialog. Files are not shown in a hierarchical view yet,
so it's essentially the same as ZipSelectDialog from Gens/GS. QTreeWidget
is used instead of QTreeView, since QTreeWidget doesn't require creating
a QAbstractItemModel subclass.

gens-qt4-ScreenShot-v0: Initial screenshot support. Saves screenshots in
the gens-qt4 directory using the same naming scheme as Gens/GS. File format
is PNG only for onw, but may be customizable later.

gens-qt4-SigHandler-v1: Updated the signal handler to work properly in
non-GUI threads.

libgens-save-data-v1: SRam/EEPRom AutoSave is implemented. It currently has
a hard-coded threshold of 1000 ms, and doesn't detect the system region yet,
so the frame counter is always checked based on NTSC timing.

gens-qt4-PortAudio-v0: Initial PortAudio implementation. It does nothing but
generate two sawtooth waves, based on the example code from the PortAudio
website: http://www.portaudio.com/trac/wiki/TutorialDir/WritingACallback

gens-qt4-osd-bitmap-v0: Use a bitmap image for the onscreen display instead
of Qt's font renderer. The bitmap image is faster, and we don't really need
to show the full Unicode character set onscreen. (Only U+0000 - U+FFFF are
supported.)

libgens-save-data-v0: SRam and EEPRom data is loaded and saved on ROM open
and close, respectively. Autosave is not implemented yet. New LibGens OSD
handler for display SRam/EEPRom load/save messages onscreen.

gens-credits-v0: Initial "Credits" tab in the About dilaog. This tab lists
all the contributors for Gens/GS and Gens/GS II, plus the original Gens
author and the authors and contributors of the previous Gens multiplatform
ports, e.g. Gens/BeOS and Gens/Linux.

gens-qt4-open-close-title: gens-qt4 now supports opening and closing ROMs
using the appropriate entries in the File menu. It also sets the window
title to the ROM's internal name when a ROM is running.

libgens-EEPRom-v0: Initial EEPROM support. (The class is named EEPRom for
consistency with other memory management classes in Gens/GS II.) Most of the
code was ported from Genesis Plus GX. A lot of work then went into refactoring
everything so that SRAM and EEPROM could co-exist, with EEPROM taking priority
over SRAM if the loaded ROM image matches an entry in the EEPROM database.

Genesis Plus GX EEPROM source:
http://code.google.com/p/genplus-gx/source/browse/trunk/source/cart_hw/eeprom.c

libgens-controllers-v2:

- Initial Controller Configuration dialog, which currently shows the type
  of controller connected to Port 1 at the time that the dialog was opened.

- Support for L/R modifier keys (e.g. Left Alt vs. Right Alt) on X11 and
  Win32. (Mac OS X doesn't seem to expose the required functionality.)

- The 6-button TH counter now only increments on a TH rising edge, which
  improves reliability. Additionally, the TH counter is now reset after
  25 scanlines have elapsed without a TH rising edge.

- Mega Mouse doesn't check for TR transitions if it's waiting for a TH
  falling edge.

- New IoBase::reset() function to reset the controller ports on system startup.

libgens-controllers-v1: Support for 2-button (SMS/GG) controllers
on Port 1. Added a function to properly apply the effects of the
tristate buffer to the result of the readData() functions for each
controller class.

libgens-controllers-v0: Support for NULL, 3-button, and 6-button
controllers on Port 1. A framework for devices on Port 2 and Port E
(EXT) is implemented.

libgens-initial-M68K: Initial working M68K CPU core. It can run games!

libgens-big-endian-v0: Fixed all big-endian problems in libgens related
to code that's currently in use. This includes VDP and Effects. The CPU
emulatoin cores were not enabled during testing, since they're currently
x86 only.

gens-qt4-SigHandler-v0: Initial port of the Gens/GS signal handler
to Gens/GS II. It's slightly different from the original: instead
of showing the system default error icon, it shows a picture of
Rick Astley.

libgens-LOG_MSG: Ported (and updated) the LOG_MSG() subsystem from
the original Gens/GS to Gens/GS II.

gens-qt4-QGLWidget-Win32: Updated the QGLWidget implementation to work
correctly on Win32. This includes adding 32-bit color texture support,
which is needed on my VM since Microsoft's OpenGL implementation only
supports OpenGL 1.1, and 15-bit/16-bit color textures were added in
OpenGL 1.2 or 1.3.

gens-qt4-QGLWidget: Initial reworking of Gens/GS II to use QGLWidget
in gens-qt4 instead of SDL Video in LibGens.

libgens-vdp-loadFromZomg: Initial test of the VDP subsystem. A static
image is loaded from a prototype ZOMG savestate file and displayed
onscreen.

libgens-initial-vdp: Initial port of Gens/GS r7+'s VDP code into Gens/GS II.

gens-qt4-menubar-refactoring: Refactoring of the gens-qt4 menu bar system.

gens-qt4-initial-ui: Initial Qt4 UI for Gens/GS II.
