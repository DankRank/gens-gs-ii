Description of git tags for Gens/GS II:

libgens-big-endian-v0: Fixed all big-endian problems in libgens related
to code that's currently in use. This includes VDP and Effects. The CPU
emulatoin cores were not enabled during testing, since they're currently
x86 only.

libgens-LOG_MSG: Ported (and updated) the LOG_MSG() subsystem from
the original Gens/GS to Gens/GS II.

gens-qt4-QGLWidget-Win32: Updated the QGLWidget implementation to work
correctly on Win32. This includes adding 32-bit color texture support,
which is needed on my VM since Microsoft's OpenGL implementation only
supports OpenGL 1.1, and 15-bit/16-bit color textures were added in
OpenGL 1.2 or 1.3.

gens-qt4-QGLWidget: Initial reworking of Gens/GS II to use QGLWidget
in gens-qt4 instead of SDL Video in LibGens.

libgens-vdp-loadFromZomg: Initial test of the VDP subsystem. A static
image is loaded from a prototype ZOMG savestate file and displayed
onscreen.

libgens-initial-vdp: Initial port of Gens/GS r7+'s VDP code into Gens/GS II.

gens-qt4-menubar-refactoring: Refactoring of the gens-qt4 menu bar system.

gens-qt4-initial-ui: Initial Qt4 UI for Gens/GS II.
